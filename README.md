# Jungle-Creeper-Mod
This mod adds a Jungle Creeper Mob to the game. It spawns in all the Jungle Biomes.

What does this mod do?

This mod adds an entity called the Jungle Creeper. The Jungle Creeper spawns naturally in all the Jungle Biomes above sea level. The Jungle Creeper is invisible until you are very close. It has a slow movement speed but explodes really quick. This explosion is more powerful than a regular Creeper, this means the Jungle Creeper also has a higher Gunpowder drop rate. It looks a lot like the regular Creeper so watch out in the jungles.
